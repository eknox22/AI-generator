# AI Inspirational Quote Generator

## Project Description

_I created this project for the **SheCodes** AI Add-on workshop. This project is an **AI-powered inspriational quote generator** which asks users to input a theme for an inspirational quote. The quote is retrieved using the **SheCodes API** and displays the quote in a dynmaic, and engaging way using the [Typewriter.js plugin](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs)._
